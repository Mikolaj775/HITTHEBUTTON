REACT HIT THE BUTTON GAME
its a "another level again" type of game with main objective to hit the 4 buttons and main mechanics chenging every level
it is havily inspired by "just hit the button" that i once played on gx.games but i only copied like 6 out of 20 lvl and i tried to make it a lot harder and its not so pretty like "just hit the button" :(

its not optymized for screens in some levels so i recoment playing on 1920x944 or something like that
