# Hit The Button

This project contains a small browser game built with React. All code is written directly in `index.html` and `App.js` so no build step is required.

## Running Locally
1. Place your image assets in the `public/` folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser and the game should appear.

## Deploying to Netlify
1. Push this repository to your Git provider (e.g., GitHub).
2. In Netlify, choose **New site from Git** and select the repository.
3. Set **build command** to `N/A`.
4. Set **publish directory** to the repo root (`.`) and deploy.

Netlify will host the static files and load React from a CDN.
