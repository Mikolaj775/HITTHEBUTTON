This repository hosts a small React game. The game logic lives in `App.js` and is loaded directly in the browser via `index.html`.

React and ReactDOM are pulled from a CDN, so no build tools are required.

## Running Locally
Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Deploying to Netlify
1. Push this repository to your Git provider.
2. In Netlify choose **New site from Git** and select the repository.
3. Set **build command** to `N/A` (no build step).
4. Set **publish directory** to the root of the repo (`.`).
5. Deploy the site.

Netlify will serve the static files and the game will run in the browser.
